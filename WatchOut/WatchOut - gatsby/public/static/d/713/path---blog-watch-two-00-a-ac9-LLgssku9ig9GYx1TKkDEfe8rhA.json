Slightly large for my liking at 42mm, the watch is slightly bulky but is more of a showpiece than a watch. You’ll be mesmerized at first glance and you won’t be able to turn away. In fact, it might be more dangerous to drive with this watch than with your cellphone. Be forewarned.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"slug":"watch-two","title":"Patek Philipe"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"watch-two"}}
