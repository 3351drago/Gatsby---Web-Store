Well priced between 25,000 and 35,000 euros, the watch is available in platinum and yellow or rose gold. The 38mm timepiece is a quintessential dress watch with that contemporary Eastern European flair. The new models have a larger balance wheel than the predecessor (which in my opinion was a better watch) and gives a more accurate reading. The only issue I really have with the Lange I is that they need to move the time indicator to the other side of the watch since it will almost always require a lift of the cuff to see it. Overall, an exemplary timepiece.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"slug":"watch-nine","title":"Rolex"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"watch-nine"}}
