## Feeling so smooth

How is this statement letting you feel ? Omega Globemaster Annual Calendar, a timepiece radiating depth and maturity. The 18 carat Sedna Gold bezel, a specifically by Omega created rosegold composition. The serrated appearance – an emblem for steps. Steps anybody walks in life.

„ Step after Step " – in reality….     Steps walked in rosegold „ …                 misjuged ?

The high elegant and deep – grey face, metalic nuanced, celebrating solarisation, flows in harmony with the transparent backcase. The backcase is ornamented by a centric positioned medallion. The motiv – an observatory with 8 excitingly composed stars. 8 stars for 8 exams, ´cause only after passing the exams in totality an Official Master Chronometer is born.

This extraordinary cerification has been created by Omega itself and undoubtable stands for quality on highest standards – talking High Technology ! As comparison …. lets take the analogy of ski – sports. The athletes competing to one another in the World Cup – all of them are high qualified ski – artist and athletes. Yet at the end, only the créme de la créme stands on the pedestal and inhales the achievement.
