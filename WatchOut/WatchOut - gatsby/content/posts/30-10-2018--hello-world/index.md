## Look classy

The case composed of Titanium, the sceletonized face in extravagance, a transparancy which next to the groundbreaking beauty and excitement, allows, even to a layman deepest insights into one of the most fascinating craftmanships – the art of watchmaking. What a spectacle !

Yet simultaneously, transparancy is with this extraordinary mens watch Defy El Primero 21, (by the way, its companion El Primero – a manufacture Calibre of Zenith, has as heart beaten as well within the Elite ROLEX) yet the beginning. 

And now, here we go … The power unit, the engine with high frequency vibration …  is to be used plural. 

For regarding this extraordinary, exquisitly – unique, one of a kind time piece, there is not solely beating one heart within. No. Two hearts are beating ! One for the 3 finger engine, and one for the chronograph power unit. And all of that completed and centralised within one movement. Unbelievable – right ? What an attitude !
