## Safe and sound

Uncountable rounds in ultra high speed. 

Humankind and machine a genius couple. Border after border – consistently exceeded.

Location Gym – the last round is on and the muscles start to pull until strongly bridging into burning. The border is now docked. Muscles grow through stimulation, an impulse being provoced during workout. What matters, is the ability to resist the challenge. Still putting another shovel on. Focused with forward facing tunnel vision and the knowledge in the back of ones head, that exactly this is the entrance and path into the next level. The art here, is to reach genius balance. So called fine-tuning ! Regarding racing sports … Indeed, driving level is at the limit, yet the engine is not allowed to overheat ! As said: 

An art that manifactures peaks !  An homage to life, right ?
