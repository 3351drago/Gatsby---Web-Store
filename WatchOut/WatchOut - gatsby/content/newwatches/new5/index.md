As rare as beluga caviar, as revered as a Rolls Royce, this timepiece is about as superlative as it gets. What’s exceptionally unique and attractive about this offering is that despite its complicated architecture, it’s capable of being serviced by any watchmaker worth their salt. The movement is exceptional, the aesthetics unsurpassed. It’s one of those watches you’ll want to lock away in a vault if you ever have the opportunity to acquire one. Reasonably priced at just under CHF 80,000, it’s worth every penny.
