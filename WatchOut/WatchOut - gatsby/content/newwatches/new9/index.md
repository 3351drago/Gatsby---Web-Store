Forget the standard Submariner and Seamaster by Rolex and Omega, the X Fathoms by Blancpain is arguably the most eligible dive watch for deep-sea, unchartered-waters style dives. The decompression valve is easy to use, it offers a double-depth gauge and a retrograde five minute sub-counter. Easy to read with maximum depth memory, its only drawback is that the advertised ‘orange’ glow disappears after the fifty-foot mark.
