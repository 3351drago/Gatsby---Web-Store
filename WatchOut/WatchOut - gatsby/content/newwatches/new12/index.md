For whatever reason, many collectors tend to look down at Bvlgari. While granting that some of their watches are an insult to horology, this particular timepiece is easily one of the finest wristwatches on the market. Priced respectably at CHF 980,000, the in-house movement offers separate power reserves for the movement and the Sonnerie. Worth noting is that the Westminster Grande Sonnerie is the the most difficult complication to produce and Bvlgari has done it so well it seems effortless. The automatic perpetual movement uses a tourbillon for added precision and makes this timepiece worth the almost million dollar price tag. On top of that itâ€™s spectacularly beautiful.
