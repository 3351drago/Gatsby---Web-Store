Like a perfected aria, the beauty of this timepiece is magnetic. Like a window to heaven, the partially skeletonized dial offers a glimpse into the architecture and artistry of the ARM09 movement within.  As elegant as the movement is, the case is a little chunky, giving that retro appeal. Priced between CHF 22,000 and 32,000, the only big drawback is that the watch deserves to come with a nicer strap.
