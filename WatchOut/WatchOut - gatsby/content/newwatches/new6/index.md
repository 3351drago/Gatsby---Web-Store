Designed by Frederic Garinaud, who is the brains behind the Harry Winston OPVS8, this timepiece, respectably priced at under CHF 40,000, houses a custom integrated column-wheel mono-pusher chronograph and offers the owner the unique opportunity to select between a tachymeter and pulsometer scale. An excellent selection for any gentleman, the one drawback is that its exceptionally bulky case measures in at 46mm. However, despite that, itâ€™s still surprisingly comfortable on a larger wrist.
