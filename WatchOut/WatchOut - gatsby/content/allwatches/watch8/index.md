It’s oversized balance wheel beats low and beautiful, it’s aesthetic appeal is unparalleled, and the price is almost too low at a starting rate of just CHF 18,000. Slightly large for my liking at 42mm, the watch is slightly bulky but is more of a showpiece than a watch. You’ll be mesmerized at first glance and you won’t be able to turn away. In fact, it might be more dangerous to drive with this watch than with your cellphone. Be forewarned.
